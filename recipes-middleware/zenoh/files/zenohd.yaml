# Zenohd configuration file for Maivin.  The zenohd service is setup to run as
# a router and listen on the localhost interface on port 7447.  Maivin services
# are configured to connect to the zenohd service on the localhost interface in
# client-only mode.  The multicast discovery feature is disabled as we do not
# want Maivin services transmitted across the network.
#
# To allow remote connections to Maivin the listen endpoint should be updated to
# listen on tcp/0.0.0.0:7447 to allow connections from any interface.
#
# To have the Maivin forward services to another device configure the connect
# endpoint to the desired device.  For example a PC with the IP address 1.2.3.4
# would be configured using the endpoint "tcp/1.2.3.4:7447".
#
# Another option is to use the Zenoh REST API plug-in for zenohd which provides
# an HTTP server hosting the REST API.  Refer to Zenoh REST API for details.
